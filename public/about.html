<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a junior UX/UI designer from Taiwan with experience 
  in the public sector, currently based in Melbourne, Australia. </p>

<p>During my government career, I felt fulfilled guiding the public to 
  complete the clearance process in our system. The interest led me to 
  complete a UX boot camp and pursue a master's degree at Monash Univesity.</p>

<p>DI consider myself a detail-oriented person, and planning things in advance 
  gives me a sense of satisfaction. Throughout the process, I always considered 
  every possibility and figured out the solutions. In the future, I'd like to seek 
  more opportunities to bridge the gap between technology and daily life to create 
  a more equitable society for all people.</p>
